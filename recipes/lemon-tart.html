        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3><em>Crust</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://prettysimplesweet.com/sweet-tart-crust/">Fully baked tart crust</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3><em>Lemon Curd Filling</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs plus 2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <ul>
                <li>2-3 lemons for both zest and juice</li>
            </ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium heatproof bowl, place eggs, sugar, lemon 
                zest, lemon juice, and heavy cream and whisk to combine. 
                Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Cook 
                on moderate heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture 
                becomes thick (may take up to 20 minutes). If you have a 
                thermometer, it should register 150 degrees F or 75 degrees 
                C; otherwise, it should coat the back of a wooden spoon and 
                leave a clear pass if you run your finger through it. The 
                curd will thicken more once cooled.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and immediately strain mixture through 
                a sieve. Add butter, a few cubes at a time, and wisk until 
                completely melted and incorporated and mixture is smooth. 
                Take your time with it--the whisking makes for an airy and 
                light texture. Allow to cool to room remperature before 
                filling the tart. (Lemon curd can be kept in an airtight 
                container in the fridge for up to week, or can be frozen 
                for up to 2 months. To thaw, place overnight in the fridge. 
                Whisk the mixture to smoothen it before using.)</li>
            <li>Fill the tart shell with lemon curd, then refridgerate 
                for at least 4 hours until chilled. Serve with berries and 
                whipped cream if you like. The tart is rich, so cut your 
                servings small!
            </li>
