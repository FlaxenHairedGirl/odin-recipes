        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3><em>For the Cinnamon Rolls:</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 packet of active dry rapid rise yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup warm non dairy milk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegan butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups 1:1 gluten gree flour</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We recommend Bob's 1:1 Baking Flour</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3><em>For the Filling:</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons vegan butter, room temperature</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><em>For the Vegan Cream Cheese Frosting</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegan cream cheese</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We found Miyokos gave the best consistency,
                    but Daiya or Kite Hill also worked great!</li>
            </ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegan butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons non dairy milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the milk, sugar, and yeast in a stand mixer 
                fitted with the dough hook. Allow to sit for 5 minutes. 
                The mixture should foam, signaling that the yeast is active.</li>
            <li>Add the melted butter, 1 cup of the flour, and the salt. 
                Mix until just combined. Add the remaining flour and mix 
                until the dough forms a ball and comes together. Turn the 
                dough out onto a heavily floured surgace and knead for 15 
                minutes or until the dough is mostly smooth.</li>
            <li>Coat a large bowl with oil and place the dough into the 
                bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm area to 
                proof for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon for 
                the filling. Lightly grease a 9 inch round baking pan. Set 
                both aside.</li>
            <li>After 1 hour, the dough should be doubled in size. Turn 
                the dough our onto a liberally floured work surgace. 
                Roll the dough into a 9 x 13 inch rectangle. The dough 
                will be thick. This is what you want. Spread the melted 
                butter over the dough, coating it evenly all the way to 
                the edge. Sprinkle on the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture 
                and rub into the butter to comine.</li>
            <li>Working from the long edge, roll the dough into a log, 
                pinching the ends so it stays together. Using a serrated 
                knife or dental floss (even better!), cut the dough into 
                8 equal buns. Place into prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Allow the dough to rise a second time. Cover the pan with 
                a cloth and let rest in a warm place for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake for 20-30 minutes, 
                until the cinnamon buns are golden brown on top.</li>
            <li>While the cinnamon rolls are baking, make the cream cheese 
                frosting. Combine all frosting ingredients in a bowl and 
                whisk until cobined.</li>
            <li>Once the cinnamon rolls are out of the oven, cool for 10 
                minutes. Microwave the frosting for 10-15 seconds to thin 
                it out slightly, then spread over the warm cinnamon rolls 
                and serve!</li>
